The comea scripts here are used for COM unit- and integration tests when testing COM 
in combination with an old COMEA version that implements SPI revision 1.1.0.

SPI revision 1.1.0 includes LDAP configuration functionality (sdp2531) 
but it does not include COMEA Hardening (sdp2524) or SPI revisioning (MR24657).
